Obstacles would come in from off screen and collide with the sprite. The gamer must move the sprite to avoid the collision.

objects (barrels) would come from one direction, a set amount of time must pass between them to allow the player to avoid it.
Objects must come from one direction until the 'wave' is done. Player must be informed of the wave direction change.

Scores are given based on the number of obstacles the player can avoid.
